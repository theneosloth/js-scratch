# js-scratch

A scratch buffer that evals javascript code using your web browser and a websocket connection.

## How to use

Run js-scratch and keep the tab open. C-x C-e evaluates the current **line** or region. Because this was built to be as simple as posible you would need to select a region if you want to eval a multi-line definition.


Tested only on Firefox 79.0.
